You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.[^2]

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format[^1]:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets[^2]:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

# There's 80 cols necessary to be supported in the template, otherwise I'll str
# uggle.
{% endhighlight %}

[^1]: whatever. and [link](https://ruby.cz/).
[^2]: There's `--livereload` flag that's also cool to use. But I think I'm not ready to look into that just yet. And it should be even longer because why not. We want to wrap, and BAD.
